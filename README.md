# KKABMX (BonemodX)
Koikatsu! mod that adds more character customization settings to character maker. These additional settings are saved inside the card and used by the main game and studio. It is possible to change male height, make good-looking thick necks, customize skirts, adjust hand and feet size and much more.

## Changes from original ABM
This is an upgraded version of the original Koikatu ABM/Bonemod plugin. It fixes multiple issues with the original while adding new features.
- Added controls integrated into character maker interface
- Added ability to have different skirt bone settings for each outfit type
- Improved performance, no more stuttering or FPS drops
- No more .txt files, everything is saved into the cards themselves (will still read .txt files and delete them after re-saving the card)
- Refactoring and cleanup of the source code, a lot of useless fat trimmed
- Misc bugfixes and improvements
